# ContactMePage_htmlcssMiniProject

So, here is my second mini project using basic HTML and CSS. I've created a 'Contact Us' page, and it is fully functional. If you open it and submit a message, it will be directly received by me. I'm doing my best!

Feel free to use this or let me know if you have any specific preferences or additional information you'd like to include!
